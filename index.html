<p> <u> Minerals </u> - Minerals are natural substances that have definite composition. All rocks are composed of minerals. There are about 3500 known type of minerals. Minerals are extracted from ores.
<p> <u> Ores </u> - An ore is a naturally occurring solid material that contains a large amount of a particular mineral.</p>
<br> <br>
<p> Minerals can be classified into two types :- Metallic and Non-metallic minerals</p>
	<hr>
<h1> Metallic minerals </h1>
<p> Metallic minerals contain metals, which are hard substances that conduct heat and electricity. They are mainly found in igneous rocks which are formed by heat. These metals generally have lustre or shine. Metallic minerals are further divided into two types.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>1. Ferrous minerals - </dt>
		<dd> They are the minerals which contain iron such as iron ore, chrome etc </dd>
	<dl>
		<dt>2. Non ferrous minerals - </dt>
		<dd>  They are the minerals which do not contain iron such as gold, silver etc. </dd>

There are 4 different types of iron ores â€“ Magnetite contains 75% iron, Haematite contains 70% iron, Limonite contains 60% iron and Siderite contains 40% iron. Iron is used to make steel. Steel is used to make kitchen utensils. Steel is the backbone of any industrialized country.

<h1> Mining </h1>
<div class = "mining">
<p> Mining is the process of taking out minerals d other substances from  the earth. Minerals such as iron ore, uranium, bauxite natural gas petrolem, coal, etc. are mined. There are two types of mining -
</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>1. Surface mining - </dt>
		<dd> In surface mining, the top layer of the soil is removed, large pits or holes <a href = "https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.zFEsKhyr6Wxr0dCxpOajjQHaE7?w=267&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7"><img src = "https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.zFEsKhyr6Wxr0dCxpOajjQHaE7?w=267&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7"></a>are dug and the rocks that lie underneath are extracted with the help of heavy machinery. These pits are called open cast mines or quarries. In surface mining,  trees and other natural vegetation are destroyed. Surface mining is done to extravt minerals that are found close to the surface such as coal, mica, limestone, etc.
 </dd>
<br> <br><br> <br>
 
	<dl>
		<dt>2. Underground mining - </dt>
		<dd>  In underground mining, a shaft, which is  long narrow passage, is dug vertically <a href = "https://blog.iseekplant.com.au/hs-fs/hubfs/elteniente5.jpg?width=900&name=elteniente5.jpg"> <img src = "https://blog.iseekplant.com.au/hs-fs/hubfs/elteniente5.jpg?width=900&name=elteniente5.jpg" height="200" width = "250"> </a> deep<br> into the ground. People and machinery are then sent down through this shaft. Sometimes <br>after descending into the shaft tunnels are blasted into the earth with the help of dynamites. Then the men and the machines move about through these tunnels to take out things such as gold, copper, tin, lead, etc. Underground mining causes the sinking of the land, underground water pollution, etc.

<h1>Conservation of Minerals </h1>

<ul type = "square">
<li>Minerals are non renewable resources so the get exhausted very quickly and take thousands of years to form</li>
<li>But today, minerals are being used at a very fast rate</li>
<li>Hence we must learn to conserve minerals</li>
<li>We can save minerals by pracising to reduce, recycle and reuse</li>
<li>Cycling or walking must be used to go short distances. For long distnce, public trnsport or car pool should be used. This can save petrol</li>
<li>We must use alternate sources energy such as sun, water or air.</li>
